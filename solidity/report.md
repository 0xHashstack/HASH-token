# Low Issues

## L-1: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol [Line: 4](lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L4)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```

- Found in lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol [Line: 4](lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L4)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```



## L-2: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

	```solidity

	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol [Line: 92](lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol#L92)

	```solidity
	    function upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data) public payable virtual onlyProxy {
	```



## NC-2: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event Initialized(uint64 version);
	```
