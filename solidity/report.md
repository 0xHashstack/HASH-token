# Medium Issues

## M-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 25](src/token/HashToken.sol#L25)

	```solidity
	contract HashToken is IHashToken, Ownable2Step, ERC20Permit, ERC20Votes {
	```

- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 30](src/token/HashToken.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 46](src/token/HashToken.sol#L46)

	```solidity
	    function rescueTokens(IERC20 token, address to) external override onlyOwner {
	```



## M-2: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 31](src/token/HashToken.sol#L31)

	```solidity
	        _mint(to, amount);
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 15](src/token/HashToken.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```



## L-2: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 15](src/token/HashToken.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 30](src/token/HashToken.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/token/HashToken.sol [Line: 38](src/token/HashToken.sol#L38)

	```solidity
	    function nonces(address owner) public view override(ERC20Permit, Nonces) returns (uint256) {
	```
